1)  Go to the telephone model group page from flickr_groups.txt.
    Scroll every galerry page to the end and download as html file to the corresponding folder.
    As a result you will have a set of folders with .html files corresponding to a specific phone model at "html_pages" folder.
    
2)  Run the pages_to_image_links.py
    The result of the script will be folder "links" of .csv files with links to photos of each phone model.
    
3)  Run the download_from_links.py to download images from the links received 
    in the previous paragraph(You can skip previous two steps, because the "links" already contains necessary files).
